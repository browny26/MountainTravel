# Travel The Mountains - Design Replication Documentation

## Overview
This project replicates a visually compelling design inspired by an image found on Pinterest. The webpage uses modern web technologies and libraries to achieve smooth animations, clean layout designs, and a responsive user interface. It features a mountain travel guide concept with prominent typography, image sections, and a parallax-like scrolling experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup structure.
- **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Smooth animations and scroll-based effects.
- **Bootstrap Icons**: For iconography.
